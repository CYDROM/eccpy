    Notes
    -----
    assay_type : string
        Data format, as recognised from the raw input file.
    data_file_path : filepath
        Path to the file containing the response data. Note that some input files will contain both dose and
        response data (e.g. Excel inputs). Others only contain response data, with doses provided in a separate file.
    data_file : string
        input file name
    df_eval_values : pandas DataFrame
        For developers only. Returns the dataframe showing the evaluated LD50 values for the experiment.
    dff : pandas DataFrame
        Dataframe for Files. Contains all the paths for input and output files.
        Created from the "files" tab of the settings excel file.
    dfm: pandas DataFrame
        For developers only. The dataframe showing the evaluated LD50 values for all experiments combined.
        The index contains each unique sample. The columns include Mean, Std and SEM.
    dose_conc_excel_path : string
        File path for the accompanying excel file, that contains the dose data for a 96-well assay.
    df_resp_orig : DataFrame
        Dataframe containing the the original response data.
    df_resp_all : String
        String, to be replaced with a dataframe later.
    df_dose_orig : DataFrame
        Dataframe containing the dose concentrations. Needs to be standardised so that the index and columns
        matche the response dataframe.
    df_dose_orig : pandas DataFrame
        The original dataframe with the dose data for standardisation. It will, for example, show a horizontal
        increase in dose for 96-well assay, with 12 dose concentrations and 8 samples, but a vertical increase
        in dose for 8 dose concentrations and 12 samples.
    df_resp_all : pandas DataFrame
        Dataframe with the response data, which is usually more uniform than the dose data and requires less
        standardisation. For 96-well formats, this is already created and will simply be returned. For 12-well
        formats containing dose and response data in excel format, this object will be created.
    df_resp_all : String
        String, to be replaced with a dataframe later.
    df_resp_orig : pandas DataFrame
        Dataframe containing the the original response data.
    settings : pandas Series
        Parameter settings for fitting, and data analysis
    EC50_analysis_fig_01 : png (also as pdf)
        Scattergram with all data and sigmoidal curves for that experiment.
        Bar-chart with all calculated EC50 values for that experiment, sample letter only on x-axis.
    EC50_analysis_fig_02 : png (also as pdf)
        Bar-chart with all calculated EC50 values for that experiment,
        full name on x-axis
    fn : int
        File number in list of files to analyse.
    fig0_single_sample_png : png (also as pdf)
        Fitted sigmoidal curve for an individual sample. Contains details regarding the
        automatic judement as to whether the "data_needs_checking" or whether the data seems okay. Contains curves
        for original data, and also adjusted datasets (e.g. "fixed upper limit", or in future "outliers removed")
    input_data_file_seems_okay : bool
        Whether the file seems to be intact, and contains one of the identifiers specifying the data format.
    input_data_file_seems_okay : bool
        Whether the file seems to be intact, and contains one of the identifiers specifying the data format.
    ident_txtstr : string
        String inserted into the raw datafile to identify datatype
    list_96_well_doseconc_types : list of strings
        List of formats that can be parsed by the module.
    ofd_EC50_eval_csv : csv
        Output summary csv file with EC50 values.
        Comma separation, English numbering system, with values in quotation marks to increase compatibility.
    ofd_EC50_eval_excel : excel file
        Output summary excel file with EC50 values
    sample_96_well : bool
        Whether the format is one of the 96-well formats, which utilizes a separate excel file for the dose conc.
    sample_12_well_plate : bool
        Whether the data utilises the 12-well format, which contains dose and response data in a single excel file.
    settings : pandas Series
        Parameter settings for fitting, and data analysis
    settings_excel_file : filepath
        Settings file containing the list of datafiles for analysis, and also chosen parameters
    t20 : list
        Tableau20 list of colours
